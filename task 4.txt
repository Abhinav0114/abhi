Linux (UFW):
1. Open Firewall Configuration Tool
 Open the terminal.
 Use command-line interface for UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall).

2. List Current Firewall Rules
   check the firewall status numbers.

3. Add Rule to Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)
   Now block the port 23. 

4. Test the Rule by Connecting to Port 23
   Use tools like telnet to try connecting
   Should be rejected or fail to connect.

5. Add Rule to Allow SSH (Port 22, Linux Only)
   Now allow port 22.

6. Remove the Block Rule to Restore State

7. Documented Commands/GUI Steps Used
   Linux	
   ufw status numbered	
   ufw deny 23/tcp	
   ufw allow 22	
   ufw delete deny 23/tcp

8. How Firewalls Filter Traffic (Summary)
   Firewalls filter network traffic by allowing or blocking connections based on defined rules:

   Inbound rules control traffic entering the system.

   Outbound rules control traffic leaving the system.

   They match traffic attributes (port, IP, protocol) to rules then allow/deny connections.

   Example: Blocking port 23 prevents Telnet connections, helping to secure the host.

   Firewalls are critical to system security, enabling administrators to limit access and reduce risk of unauthorized entry, malware, or exploitation.
